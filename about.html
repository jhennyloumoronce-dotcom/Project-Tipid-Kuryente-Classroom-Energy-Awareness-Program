            <h3>Purpose of the Project</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this research is to examine the current energy-using practices within the school and to promote effective strategies that can reduce unnecessary electricity consumption. Specifically, the study aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify common appliances and behaviors that contribute to energy waste in classrooms and other school facilities.</li>
                <li>Assess the level of awareness among students and teachers regarding proper energy conservation practices.</li>
                <li>Implement simple initiatives—such as Energy Patrol Teams, eco-signages, room-to-room discussions, and online reminders—to encourage responsible energy use.</li>
                <li>Evaluate how these initiatives help improve awareness and reduce energy-wasting behaviors within the school.</li>
                <li>Provide recommendations that the school community can adopt to create a more energy-efficient environment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, this research seeks to strengthen students’ understanding of energy conservation and promote sustainable habits that support both the school and the environment.</p>
