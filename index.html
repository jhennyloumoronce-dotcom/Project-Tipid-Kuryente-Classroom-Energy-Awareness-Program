            <h1>Save Energy, Shape Our Future!</h1>
            <p>Energy conservation starts with awareness. Every student, teacher, and staff member can contribute to reducing electricity use in our school. By making simple changes like turning off unused lights or unplugging devices, we not only save energy but also help protect the environment and lower our school’s electricity costs. Together, small actions can lead to big results.</p>

            <h2>Why Every Watt Counts</h2>
            <p>Energy conservation in schools is more than just switching off lights—it has measurable environmental, financial, and educational impacts:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Schools can account for up to 20% of a building’s total energy use. Reducing unnecessary electricity use lowers carbon emissions and contributes to a greener planet.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial Savings:</strong> Simple actions like turning off unused lights and appliances can save 15 kWh per classroom per month, helping the school reduce energy bills.</li>
                <li><strong>Standby Power Waste:</strong> Chargers and idle appliances still consume energy when not in use, contributing to approximately 10% of total electricity waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Value:</strong> Teaching students energy-saving habits instills long-term awareness and responsibility toward sustainable living.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By understanding why energy conservation matters, everyone in the school community can take meaningful steps toward efficiency.</p>
